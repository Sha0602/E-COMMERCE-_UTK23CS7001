 Node.js Web Application

## ðŸ“– About the Project

This Node.js-based web application is designed to serve as a foundational backend system capable of handling HTTP requests, middleware processing, authentication, and more. Built using Express.js and a rich ecosystem of Node packages, this project supports rapid development and integration with front-end systems, mobile apps, or third-party APIs. It also emphasizes modular architecture, making it easy to scale and maintain over time.

The project includes essential functionality such as environment configuration, database connectivity, session and token-based authentication, and a dynamic routing system. With middleware for parsing, logging, and error handling, it ensures clean request flows and maintainability. Developers can customize this base for e-commerce platforms, portfolio backends, REST APIs, or real-time apps with socket support.
